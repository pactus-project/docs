ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to the Pactus Blockchain documentation!

Pactus is built on the principle that a fair and transparent system can only be achieved through decentralization.
Unlike many other blockchain platforms, Pactus aims to eliminate the potential for centralization and manipulation
by removing the need for delegation and miners.
This allows anyone to become a part of the ecosystem and ensures that the platform remains truly decentralized.

Pactus aims to create a user-friendly blockchain that can be easily used by anyone, not just tech experts.
Our protocol is designed to be simple, easy to maintain, and develop.
Pactus offers a simple GUI application that makes it easy for users to run a node.

Transaction fees are calculated based on a percentage model with a minimum and maximum fee.
These parameters provide greater control over the fee structure and prevent overpaying or underpaying.
The percentage-based model ensures fairness and predictability, and can be adjusted through consensus among all validators.
