title: Become A Validator

The Pactus blockchain is empowered by the
[Solid State Proof-of-Stake](/protocol/consensus/proof-of-stake) mechanism.
This ensures security and stability, with network validators playing a crucial role.
There are no restrictions on the number of validators on the Pactus blockchain,
allowing anyone to participate and earn PAC coin rewards while enhancing network security.
Pactus does not pre-select validators, instead,
they are self-elected through a randomization algorithm based on their stake and luck.

## What Roles do Validators Play?

Validators can run Pactus Core software on their personal computers or remote servers to process transactions, create blocks,
and uphold network security and decentralization.
By staking their own coins, validators contribute to the network's security and are rewarded for their efforts.

## Validator Rewards

When a validator successfully proposes a block that is accepted by the network,
they receive a block reward.
This reward serves as an [incentive](/protocol/blockchain/incentive)
for validators to continue supporting the network while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Pactus ecosystem.

## Minimum requirements

After thorough testing on multiple machines, we can conclude that
the recommended minimum hardware requirements are as follows:

**Personal Computer:**

- CPU's: 2 physical cores / 4vCPU
- RAM: 4 GB Ram
- Storage (SSD): 64 GB SSD Drive
- Network: stable internet connection with over 15 MBps speed

**Private server:**

- CPU's: 1/2 physical core / 1vCPU
- RAM: 1 GB Ram
- Storage (SSD): 20 GB NVMe Drive
- Network: stable internet connection with 1 Gbps speed
